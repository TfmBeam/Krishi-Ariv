To remove unused platforms from your Flutter project:

1. Delete the following folders from your project root:
   - macos/
   - windows/
   - ios/ (if not building for iOS)

2. You can do this in VS Code's file explorer or with these PowerShell commands:

   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\macos
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\windows
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\ios

3. After deleting, run:

   flutter clean
   flutter pub get

Your project will now only target Android. You can ignore plugin warnings for other platforms.
